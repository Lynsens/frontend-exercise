## About this project

This project is instructed by Fethc's frontend exercise (https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/frontend.html)

## Features

- **Validation**
    - the form will only submit when all fields are filled and when all fields passed the validation 
    - `name` field takes the format of 'xxx xxx'
    - `password` field requires at least 8 characters long and includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number
    - `email` field takes the format of 'xxxx@xxx.xxx'
- **Submittion**
    - when Post request successful, a message will pop up
    - when Post request failed, an alert will pop with the error message
- **Accessbility**
    - each input field is associated with a label using the `htmlFor` attribute. The `aria-describedby` attribute is used to associate a description with each input field. This ensures that users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies can easily navigate and understand the form.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
